# 389. Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter which was added in t.

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        pass


test_cases = [
    {
        "method": "findTheDifference",
        "s": "abcd",
